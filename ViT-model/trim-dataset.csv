(Aug. 22, 2017) -- I am old enough to remember some very good days in America's past, the days when police officers were treated with respect; when firefighters only had to fight fires and not thugs shooting at them; when teachers could turn their backs to write on the blackboard without wondering if a student would pull a gun on them; when professors taught students how to think rather than what to think; when children grew up with two parents and all their siblings had the same parents; when cars did not have thousands of dollars' worth of absurd safety equipment because a few idiots do not know how to drive; when a farmer could plow his field without being sued by a federal agency; when U.S. troops could fire at the enemy without first having to get permission from a Defense Department attorney thousands of miles away; when boys were boys and girls were girls; when the only people with tattoos were in the Navy; when popular songs did not contain profanity and references to prostitution and cop-killing; when people were ashamed to be on welfare, rather than eager to collect it; when merely exhaling did not result in criticism for poisoning the atmosphere; when abortion was something to be ashamed of, rather than a gender-selection procedure; when kids spent their summers outdoors rather than at video game consoles; when you did not have any idea of the politics of your favorite performer; and when people generally treated each other with respect.

MSNBC political correspondent Joy Reid apparently took her cue from network colleague Lawrence O'Donnell, who used his pulpit as host of MSNBC's The Last Word to try to tie Kelly's criticisms of a black female lawmaker with the decorated general's Oak Square background:
